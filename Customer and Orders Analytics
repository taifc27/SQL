#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 

#1. How many orders were placed in January?
SELECT COUNT(*) 
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales 
WHERE orderID <> 'OrderID' 
AND LENGTH(orderID)=6;

#2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone?
SELECT COUNT(orderid)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE Product='iPhone'
AND LENGTH(orderid)=6
AND orderID <> 'OrderID';

#3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.
SELECT DISTINCT acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.customers c INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales f ON c.order_id=f.orderID
WHERE LENGTH(orderID)=6 
AND orderID <> 'OrderID';

#4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?
SELECT DISTINCT Product, price
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE price IN (SELECT MIN(price) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales) ;

#5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
SELECT Product, SUM(quantity)*price AS revenue
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales 
GROUP BY Product;

#6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT Product, SUM(Quantity), SUM(Quantity)*price AS revenue
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY Product;

#7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT cust.acctnum), AVG(Quantity*price) AS avg_amount
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust 
ON cust.order_id=Feb.orderID
WHERE Feb.Quantity >2
AND LENGTH(orderid)=6
AND orderid<> 'OrderID';
