# Final SQL Project using a dataset called chinook, which represents a 
digital media store and includes tables for artists, albums, media tracks,
invoices, and customers. I also worked with the database diagram to visualize 
how the tables were related to each other. 

#1. Show customers who are not in the USA.
SELECT FirstName, LastName, CustomerId, Country 
FROM chinook.customers 
WHERE Country != 'USA';

#2. Show only the customers from Brazil.
SELECT * 
FROM chinook.customers 
WHERE Country = 'Brazil';

#3. Find the Invoices of customers who are from Brazil. The resulting table should show the
customer's full name, Invoice ID, Date of the invoice, and billing country.
SELECT cust.FirstName, cust.LastName, inv.InvoiceId, inv.BillingCountry, inv.InvoiceDate
FROM chinook.invoices as inv 
LEFT JOIN chinook.customers AS cust 
ON inv.CustomerId = cust.CustomerId 
WHERE inv.BillingCountry = 'Brazil';

#4. Show employees who are Sales Agent.
SELECT * 
FROM chinook.Employees
WHERE Title = 'Sales Support Agent';

#5. Find a unique/distinct list of billing countries from the Invoice table.
SELECT DISTINCT BillingCountry 
FROM chinook.Invoices;

#6. Provide a query that shows the invoices associated with each sales agent. 
The resulting table should include the Sales Agent's full name.
SELECT emp.LastName, emp.Firstname, inv.InvoiceId
FROM chinook.Employees emp 
JOIN chinook.Customers cust 
ON cust.SupportRepId = emp.EmployeeId
JOIN chinook.Invoices inv 
ON inv.CustomerId = cust.CustomerId;

#7. Show the Invoice Total, Customer name, Country, and Sales Agent name for all invoices and customers.
SELECT emp.LastName, emp.Firstname, cust.FirstName, cust.LastName, cust.Country, inv.total
FROM chinook.employees emp 
JOIN chinook.Customers cust 
ON cust.SupportRepId = emp.EmployeeId
JOIN chinook.Invoices inv 
ON inv.CustomerId = cust.CustomerId;

#8. How many Invoices were there in 2009?
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM chinook.Invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate BETWEEN '2009-01-01' AND '2009-12-31';

#9. What are the total sales for 2009?
SELECT SUM(Total)
FROM chinook.Invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate BETWEEN '2009-01-01' AND '2009-12-31';

#10. Write a query that includes the purchased track name with each invoice line ID.
SELECT t.Name, i.InvoiceLineId
FROM chinook.Invoice_items i
JOIN chinook.Tracks t 
ON i.TrackId = t.TrackId;

#11. Write a query that includes the purchased track name AND artist name with each invoice line ID.
SELECT ar.name as Artist, t.Name as Track, i.InvoiceLineId
FROM chinook.Invoice_items i
LEFT JOIN chinook.tracks t 
ON i.TrackID=t.TrackID
INNER JOIN chinook.albums a
ON a.AlbumID=t.AlbumID
LEFT JOIN chinook.artists ar
ON ar.ArtistID=a.ArtistID;

#12. Provide a query that shows all the Tracks, and include the Album name, Media type, and Genre.
SELECT t.Name AS track_name, a.Title AS album_title,
m.Name AS media_type, g.Name AS genre
FROM chinook.tracks t
JOIN chinook.Albums a 
ON a.AlbumId = t.AlbumId
JOIN chinook.Media_Types m
ON m.MediaTypeId = t.MediaTypeId
JOIN chinook.Genres g
ON g.GenreId = t.GenreId;

#13. Show the total sales made by each sales agent.
SELECT emp.FirstName, emp.LastName,
ROUND(SUM(inv.Total), 2) AS total_sales 
FROM chinook.Employees emp
JOIN chinook.Customers cust 
ON cust.SupportRepId = emp.EmployeeId
JOIN chinook.Invoices inv 
ON inv.CustomerId = cust.CustomerId
WHERE emp.Title = 'Sales Support Agent' 
GROUP BY emp.FirstName;

#14. Which sales agent made the most dollars in sales in 2009?
SELECT emp.FirstName, emp.LastName,
ROUND(SUM(inv.Total), 2) AS total_ales 
FROM chinook.Employees emp
JOIN chinook.Customers cust 
ON cust.SupportRepId = emp.EmployeeId
JOIN chinook.Invoices inv 
ON inv.CustomerId = cust.CustomerId
WHERE emp.Title = 'Sales Support Agent' 
AND inv.InvoiceDate LIKE '2009%' 
GROUP BY emp.FirstName
ORDER BY (round(sum(inv.Total), 2))  DESC 
LIMIT 1;
